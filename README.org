#+TITLE: Emacs Solidity Mode
#+AUTHOR: Lefteris Karapetsas

A simple language mode for the Solidity language. It is a constant work in progress as the
 language itself also progresses. For information about Solidity check the [[https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Solidity-Tutorial][Tutorial]] and the [[https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Solidity-Features][Features]] 
wiki pages.


* Installation
Simply add the the file to your load path and make sure it's loaded. It automatically adds itself as the major mode of choice for
any file saved as =.sol=.

* Features
At the moment the only features offered by this mode is syntax highlighting and basic indentation. More features are planned, which would 
interface with the solidity libraries.
